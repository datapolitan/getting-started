# Getting Started

# The "#" character tells R that this line is a comment
# Comments are meant for human users, not computers. They just ignore comments
# I'm using comments in this file to give instructions and clarify points
# You should think about using comments in your code to help explain operations and code blocks
# This is how we remind ourselves and tell others of our work in the code itself


# Put any type of basic mathematial operation (1+2, etc.)


# Run the code above by clicking the "Run" button above 
# or clicking "Cmd + Enter" (on Mac) or "CTRL + Enter" (on Windows)
# More on Running code in R from a script here:
